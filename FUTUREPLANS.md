## Future History (planning)

### 0.7.0

I want to dedicate a release just to documentation. One of my goals is
to make it easy not just to use the library, but to understand how
parsing works and how to write a parser for a given language. To that
end, I will try to make the examples file into a mini-tutorial.

It also means moving stuff back into the code from the README literate
programming style. Marginalia will produce nice-looking html. I'll
have to spruce up the doc strings.

The documentation has also gotten a little stale.

### 1.0.0

The PEG parser in all its glory.
